Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912 in London and was a mathematician who made contributions to both math and computer science. He proved that in mahtematics, that there is not a single mathematical system that has a way of deciding that will always be awnserable. In simpler terms, it is saying that it is impossible to create a machine that can solve every math equation ever. This would be crucial information for the eventual building of the fundumental logic for digital computers. One large contribution was the Turing Test. The Turing Test was a test that determines whether or not a machine can mimic human behavior. Interest in the Turing Test has reignited as current AI models have been developed in a ways that mimic human behavior for user experience, and the percentage passing the Turing Test for most modern AI models is rising.
