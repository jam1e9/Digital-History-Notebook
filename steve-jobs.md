Steve Jobs is known for founding Apple Inc. and revolutionizing user interface in commputers. The first Macintosh computer Steve Jobs made in 1984 had it so that users could navigate a computer by visual icons and clicking on them using a mouse, where as previous personal computers, you had to navigate using typing commands which were much harder to use and understand. Moving foward, he would continue making computers that focused on user friendliness, such as the iPhone.
