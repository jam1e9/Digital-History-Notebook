Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, born on December 10th, 1815, in London. She revolutionized how computers could work with her ideas. Charles Babbage, known for his own contributions to computers, was a mentor to Lovelace and asked her to translate a french written article on his work: "The Analytical Engine" into english. The Analytical Engine was an early computer that could do calculations. Along side translating the work, Lovelace also pointed out that Babbage's machine could theoretically be used to work with symbols and not just numbers. Her ideas brought a greater potential to computers beyond numbers.
